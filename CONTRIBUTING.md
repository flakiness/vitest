## Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flakiness/vitest.git fk-vitest
cd fk-vitest
pnpm install
```

## Building

This project uses [Kubik](https://github.com/flakiness/kubik) as its build system. The build script is defined in `build.mts`.

To build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

To watch:

```bash
pnpm build -w
```

This will bundle the source with esbuild and generate TypeScript declarations.

## Releasing

To release a new version:

1. Bump the version:

   ```bash
   # For a stable minor release
   pnpm version minor

   # For an alpha pre-release
   pnpm version preminor --preid=alpha
   ```

2. Push the commit and tag:

   ```bash
   git push --follow-tags
   ```

3. [Create a GitHub Release](https://github.com/flakiness/vitest/releases/new) for the new tag and publish it.

   CI will handle publishing to npm. Pre-releases are published under @next tag.
